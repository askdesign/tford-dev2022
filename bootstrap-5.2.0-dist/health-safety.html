            <p>Having begun T Ford Company as a sole proprietorship in 1983, I am proud and privileged to contribute the following brief anthology of T Ford Company Inc. (TFCI) on the occasion of my exiting of all ownership interests as of January 2019.</p>

            <p>Jack Enos and I met at Northeastern and although he was one class younger (and far more academically accomplished) than I, we knew each other and were peripheral friends. Fast forward a few years, after graduate degrees and some considerable life experiences, when Jack and I met up again, we immediately resumed our friendship. At my insistence, we combined our comparatively small businesses. After some 30 years of projects, great collaborations, quiet and thoughtful disagreements, and mutual laughs and successes, Jack has chosen to acquire 100% of the ownership and managerial control of T Ford Company Inc.</p>

           <p>I cannot imagine a better outcome for our employees, our business relationships, our clients, and selfishly, the future of T Ford Company, Inc. and its outstanding reputation.</p>

          <p>Jack is one of the most thoughtful, earnest, and considerate business professionals that I have ever known. I have no doubt that he, and the team at TFCI, including Dan, Susan, Ron, and many others will both accelerate the business, challenge themselves, and bring TFCI to an even higher level of professionalism and accomplishment. I am confident that under Jack’s management, TFCI will deliver tough civil projects to the complete satisfaction of their public and private clients.</p>  
            
          <p>As for me, I have always enjoyed living at the intersection of construction and real estate development, and my real estate entity, T Ford LLC, will continue to develop land, build and manage commercial buildings, and own and develop self-storage facilities.</p>  
            
          <p>For me personally, it has been a great ride. I want to wish Jack and his team, together with all our great engineering firms, private clients, public utilities, and municipal clients, continued success. All the best to you Jack, go team go! So very proud.</p>

          <p>When Tom and I reconnected back in 1990 I was an Engineer with a dream of becoming a Contractor. I love Engineering but really wanted to build things rather than design them. In order to pursue this dream I left an Engineering career which was a great experience, working with some of the best Geotechnical Engineers in the profession. With no equipment other than a pickup truck, I started a firm to pursue sitework type projects and found it to be a challenge to complete with firms that were better equipped. I started to cross paths with Tom and we even bid against each other on occasion. After a few of these encounters, Tom initiated a discussion about potentially joining forces and we agreed to do a “try before you buy” trial period of 6 months. Tom wanted to continue growing his Real Estate development and suggested I focus on operations. Well, we had a pretty decent 6 months and never looked back. It’s been a nice run and a true partnership. We debated issues and always came to a mutually agreeable outcome for the good of the Company. Tom did estimates on napkins and I did spreadsheets. Amazingly we would often arrive at similar numbers! One of the first memories I have of working with Tom was reading a quote he had on his wall “Go to the edge of the cliff and jump off. Build your wings on the way down.” - Ray Bradbury. A number of our earlier projects were a lot like jumping off a cliff. We learned to be better Contractors with every job and developed a reputation for doing good work and never failing. I am grateful for the faith and trust Tom had in me.</p>

          <p>T Ford Company is a great Company built with a great team of people. I am honored to take the reins and continue the successful venture Tom started. I wish Tom success and happiness in pursuing his passion for Real Estate development.</p>
